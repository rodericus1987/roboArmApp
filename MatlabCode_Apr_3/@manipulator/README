4) Turn on the robot arm using the power switch on the front of the table
5) Use the ax-12 library from the course website to control the arm
    m = manipulator;
    angles = getangles(m);

2) Power off the robot arm
3) Wait ~15 seconds
4) Power on the robot arm
5) Reload the arm using 'm = manipulator' and continue work
